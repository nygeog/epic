###### Software
This course will primarily use ArcGIS 10.x. ArcGIS runs on Windows (we'll be using Windows 7). We will hopefully have time to touch on QGIS as well. 

###Instructor InfoDaniel M. Sheehan
Geographer, GIS Analystdms2203@columbia.edu
722 W 168th St. 7th floor, room 735New York, NY 10032	###Course DescriptionThis course will introduce the key concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and illustrate how GIS data may be employed in population health research. The course will be comprised of daily lectures and lab sessions. The lectures will feature presentations of basic GIS concepts, GIS data and analysis, how to leverage GIS data to model spatial health-related phenomena, data mining, and how to use GIS output data. The lab sessions will allow course attendees to work hands-on with ESRI’s ArcGIS software package on lab exercises using spatial data, geocoding, preparing data for analysis, geoprocessing, and mapping of public health data.###PrerequisitesNo experience with GIS is assumed, but students should be familiar with computing in the Windows environment.  By the end of the course, participants will be able to:Understand the basics of using ArcGIS softwareDemonstrate processing techniques appropriate to spatial dataDiscuss the capabilities of GIS and spatial analysis as they relate to the attendees’ particular research interestsDesign data collection strategies for studies using GIS###Course ReadingsThere are no required readings. I will provide supplemental readings during the course that may be accessed here (https://github.com/nygeog/epic/tree/gh-pages/readings). ###Course StructureClass meets from 1:30 – 5:30 PM Monday – Friday for a week (20 hours total).  We will typically begin each session with a structured lecture followed by hands on applications of course material.
